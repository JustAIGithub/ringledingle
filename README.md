# Ringle Dingle
RingleDingle is a music e-greeting card for your friends and family member. Tell old boomer grampy to send a rap to his favorite grandson, and be sure to include the fact that he left his dentures at his stepmom's house. 
<br><br> 

## Here's how it works:
1. Go to [RingleDingle's Site](https://ringledingle.up.railway.app/)
2. Fill out the information in the brief form
3. Hit submit and wait
   1. (optional) file a complaint about waiting too long to apiispanen@berkeley.edu
4. Did you really need to read this?

<br>
*We're giving new meaning to the e-greeting.*

If you like what you see, [fork over some cash](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/droopycodes) so I can afford to breathe the tax-heavy Northeastern USA air.

RingleDingle was coded by Professor Doctor Scholar Drew Piispanen in 2023.<br><br><br><br>(Someday my father will finally respect me.)
