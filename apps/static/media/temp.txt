My Love for Charity

In the style of Betty White

Charity is my gf, she loves me so much,
She's always there for me, with a gentle touch.
She'd do anything for me, even take a life,
But I would never ask her to cause any strife.
Her heart is pure gold, and her love is true,
I am the luckiest person to have found you.
You make my life complete, and I'm grateful each day,
For your love that shines bright in every way.
We may not be perfect, but we're perfect together,
Our love will last forever and ever.
Thank you for being the one who loves me so much,
My beautiful Charity, my heart's sweetest touch.
