The Rise of Ringle Dingle

In the style of Johnny Cash

Once up on a time, we sent boring cards,
With words so dulle, they lowered our guards.
Then came RingleDingle, an A. I. so bright,
Changed greeting cards, made them just right.

Customized text, art, and sound,
Personalized to make harts astound.
Want Johnny Cash to sing a lull a bye?
Or thank a client with a poem, oh my

RingleDingle is now available,
Online or in cards, truly capable.
No more waysted time, no more dulle,
Make it fun, make it count, with a RingleDingle hole.
